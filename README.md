# GTAVSRMM-Java
A music manager for the Self Radio feature of Grand Theft Auto V. Tested with Java jre1.8.0_281. It is recommended to run from included run.bat file. This script makes use of "playlist" folders, which should be placed in the "User/Documents/Rockstar Games/GTA V/mm" folder. NOTE: The script deletes any pre-existing files and folders in the User Music directory. Make sure to relocate these files before running GTAVSRMM. NOTE: Script does not correctly target GTA5.exe, this will be updated soon.

Prerequisites:

    Grand Theft Auto V (Steam or R* versions will work)
    Java (JRE 8) https://www.java.com/en/download/
    
How to use:

    Open the GTA V documents folder and create a new folder called "mm".
    Copy each playlist folder into this new "mm" folder (make sure each has a unique name).
    Relocate/copy any existing msuic files out of User Music folder.
    Open and run GTAVSRMM (recommended to run with run.bat).
    Greeting message should be visible.
    Playlists should now be visible. Read through options and type the number that cooresponds to the playlist you would like to select.
    Previous songs will be removed and newly selected playlist will be copied into the active directory.
    GTAV.exe will now be launched (NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED, UPDATE COMING SOON).
