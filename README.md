# GTAVSRMM-Java
A music manager for the Self Radio feature of Grand Theft Auto V. Tested with Java jre1.8.0_281. It is recommended to run from included run.bat file. This script makes use of "playlist" folders, which should be placed in the "User/Documents/Rockstar Games/GTA V/playlists" folder. NOTE: The script deletes any pre-existing files and folders in the User Music directory. Make sure to relocate these files before running GTAVSRMM.

Prerequisites:

    Grand Theft Auto V (Steam or R* versions will work)
    Java (JRE 8) https://www.java.com/en/download/
    
How to use:

    Open the GTA V documents folder and create a new folder called "playlists".
    Copy each playlist folder into this new "playlists" folder (make sure each has a unique name).
    Relocate/copy any existing msuic files out of User Music folder, as all contents will be cleared when swapping to a new playlist.
    Open and run GTAVSRMM (recommended to run with run.bat).
    Greeting message should be visible.
    Playlists should now be visible. Read through options and type the number that cooresponds to the playlist you would like to select.
